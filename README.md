# Tic-Tac-Toe-Using-C-Sharp
This C# project is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. After each game, players are prompted to play again or exit. The code includes simple game logic, win/draw detection, and user interaction in a looped structure.
